# Speech Recognition and Sentiment Analysis System

# Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Speech Recognition and Sentiment Analysis system. The system is a collection of five interconnected projects leveraging various APIs (AssemblyAI API, OpenAI API, listen notes) to perform speech recognition and sentiment analysis. This system was developed as a way to improve the accessibility and understanding of audio data through the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

# Features
  * Audio Processing: Gain insights into essential techniques for processing audio data (wav, mp3, m4a).
  
  * Speech Recognition: Transcribe audio data to text with the AssemblyAI API.
  
  * Sentiment Analysis: Determine the sentiment of transcribed text (positive, negative, neutral).
  
  * Podcast Summarization Web App: Summarize podcasts from listen notes using speech recognition and NLP techniques.
  
  * Real-time Speech Recognition + Voice Assistant: Develop a functional voice assistant capable of real-time speech recognition incorporating OpenAI API.
